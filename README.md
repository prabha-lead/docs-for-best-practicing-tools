Below is a sample of some common rules you might include in a `.eslintrc.json` file for a React project. The rules set here are mostly based on the popular Airbnb JavaScript and React Style Guide.

Please install necessary packages like `eslint`, `eslint-plugin-react`, `eslint-config-airbnb`, `eslint-plugin-import`, `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`, and `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` before using this configuration.

```json
{
  "env": {
    "browser": true,
    "es6": true,
    "node": true,
    "jest": true
  },
  "extends": [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "plugin:react/recommended",
    "airbnb"
  ],
  "globals": {
    "Atomics": "readonly",
    "SharedArrayBuffer": "readonly"
  },
  "parser": "babel-eslint",
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaFeatures": {
      "jsx": true
    },
    "ecmaVersion": 2018,
    "sourceType": "module"
  },
  "plugins": [
    "react",
    "react-hooks"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "react/jsx-filename-extension": [1, { "extensions": [".js", ".jsx"] }],
    "react-hooks/rules-of-hooks": "error",
    "react-hooks/exhaustive-deps": "warn",
    "react/prop-types": 0,
    "react/jsx-props-no-spreading": "off",
    "no-console": "warn",
    "import/no-extraneous-dependencies": ["error", {"devDependencies": true}],
    "no-unused-vars": "warn",
    "comma-dangle": ["error", "never"]
  },
  "settings": {
    "react": {
      "version": "detect"
    }
  }
}
```

This setup includes the following highlights:

- Enforcing rules of Hooks, which is essential when using React Hooks.
- Turning off the requirement to use prop-types.
- Turning off the rule that prevents JSX prop spreading.
- Allowing `.js` and `.jsx` files to have JSX.
- Setting the ESLint environment to both browser and node (and Jest, for testing).
- Extending the configuration from the recommended ESLint, Airbnb, and React plugin rules.
- Using the `babel-eslint` parser to support modern JavaScript syntax.

Remember to adjust these settings to suit the needs of your specific project. The `.eslintrc.json` configuration should ideally be agreed upon by the whole development team to maintain a consistent coding style.
