# GIT Best Practices

## Pull from Repo

1. Use the source control view to pull changes from a remote repository.
2. Click on the "View more" option in the source control panel and select "Pull" from the dropdown menu.
3. This action will fetch and incorporate the changes from the remote repository into your local environment.
4. Before pulling changes from a remote repository, ensure that you are on the correct branch. You can check the current branch in the left-end corner of VS Code.
5. Always synchronize changes by clicking on the icon at the left-end corner after the branch name before pulling from the current branch.
